  "part1": {"content": "Welcome to the Cyber Discovery Discord Server! This is a place to discuss all things Cyber Discovery (and a few things tangentially related as well), to meet like-minded people, and to learn more about cyber security! Below is an explanation of the rules here, as well as some of the roles we have; please take a moment to read them!\n\n\n**__RULES__**\n\nWe would like to make it clear that all of these rules are intended to enforce one key tenet - Don't be a dick. We're all here to try and have some fun and learn something about cyber security - keep that in mind when considering your actions :smiley:\n\n```No offensive messages or nicknames - Anything that a reasonable person may find offensive.\n\nNo spam - This includes but is not limited too: loud/obnoxious noises in voice, @mention spam, character spam, image spam, and message spam.\n\nNo Gory, Sexual, or scary content - Screamer links, porn, nudity, death.\n\nNo harassment - Including sexual harassment or encouraging of harassment.\n\nUse the appropriate channels. Please don't post any solutions or spoilers to the challenges, and be mindful that some parts of the programme (eg. some of the specifics of the beta) are meant to remain semi-secret!\n\nSwearing is allowed so long as it isn't directed maliciously at another member.\n\nIf you aim something at another member intended as a joke and they do not take it as so, just apologise and move on.\n\nAvoid discussing any illegal activities on the server - remember people have screwed up their lives and careers in infosec by doing dodgy stuff when they were younger.```\nThere may be situations not covered by the rules or times where the rule may not fit the situation. If this happens the moderators are trusted to handle the situation appropriately. If you have a complaint about a staff member you can DM a complaint to the other staff. Any complaints made against staff will remain anonymous unless you are asked first.\n\u200c"

  "part3": {"content": "**To ensure everyone's on the same page around what doxing is, we've made some guidelines which everyone is expected to abide by:**\n\n1. Do not expose any personal information about person A without express permission from person A *ANYWHERE*, on or off the server.\n2. Personal information is any info pertaining to person A’s identity, e.g. locations, names, contact details - anything that is linked to that person.\n3. If you’re not sure whether it counts as doxing, simply *DO NOT SAY IT*. Ask the person in question FIRST.\n4. If you want to release your own personal information PUBLICLY ON THE SERVER, feel free to, but be *aware* that it can be *RE-QUOTED AT ANY TIME* as YOU have made it freely available. If there’s something that you accidentally posted or something you want deleted, *delete it or let a mod know* so that appropriate action can be taken.\n5. Don’t try to find information that can dox someone else. Ask their permission or leave it. *It’s not worth the risk* of ruining someone else’s/your time on the server.\n\n**Thank you.**\n\u200c"

This means ALL racist imagery or remarks posted by anyone on the server is sufficient grounds for punishment by a moderator. This is not up for debate - offensive content is not allowed on this server in any form. If you are upset or offended by racist or derogatory content posted on this server, DM a moderator immediately. If you are unsure if your content \"counts\" as offensive, do not post it, and DM a moderator if you want clarification.\n\u200c"
