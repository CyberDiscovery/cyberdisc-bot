Do not expose any personal information about person A without express permission from person A ANYWHERE, on or off the server.\n2. Personal information is any info pertaining to person A’s identity, e.g. locations, names, contact details - anything that is linked to that person.\n3. If you’re not sure whether it counts as doxing, simply DO NOT SAY IT. Ask the person in question FIRST. \n4. If you want to release your own personal information PUBLICLY ON THE SERVER, feel free to, but be aware that it can be RE-QUOTED AT ANY TIME as YOU have made it freely available. If there’s something that you accidentally posted or something you want deleted, delete it or let a mod know so that appropriate action can be taken.\n5. Don’t try to find information that can dox someone else. Ask their permission or leave it. It’s not worth the risk of ruining someone else’s/your time on the server.```Thank you.",
