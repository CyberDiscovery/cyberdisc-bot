Unfortunately, it seems that's incorrect. The physical vault itself requires a special keycard to be inserted which, after checking the authenticity of the card, re-aligns the circular locking mechanism to unlock it and updates the interface to show that it's unlocked. However, we found that by remote accessing the interface on the vault, we could unlock the vault by doing it in reverse; getting the interface to unlock, which unlocks the vault itself.
