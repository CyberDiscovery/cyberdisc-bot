We've had an agent undercover with the Bulldogs for a while now, but the gang is quite large and it's very hard to get access to the elite group that are planning to rob the bank. However, we've just received word from our counterparts in Spain that they've arrested one of that elite group whilst he was on a trip there. He was their best hacker and now they need to replace him quickly otherwise their attack on the bank won't work.\n\nThe elite group have decided to select someone from the rest of the gang by issuing them with a hacking challenge. Whoever cracks it first gets to go with them on the robbery. If we could get our undercover agent into that group we'd almost certainly be able to disrupt their plans. The challenge is tough - there's a file and you need to overwrite the buffer to make the secret variable read: de4dc0de. Do you think you can be the first to break it?",
