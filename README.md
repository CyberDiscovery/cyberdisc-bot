The bot for the Cyber Discovery [Community Discord Server](https://discord.cyberdiscoverycommunity.uk)!

## Installation

### Creating a Bot Token

First, head over to [the Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and create an application.
Set a name, then go to the bots tab (on the left) and add a new bot. For testing purposes, it is best to have the bot private, so untick the `Public Bot` option.

You should then get the client ID of your bot and put it into this URL to join it to your Discord server:

```text
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<insert client id here>&scope=bot&
```

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the intended environment for running the Bot, as it allows for the deployment of a pre-configured environment which can be defined in [code](deployment.yaml). To run Kubernetes on your computer you can use [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) or deploy Kubernetes properly on a server.

Once you have installed Kubernetes you need to create the secret which will contain the bot token and database credentials.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic creds --from-literal BOT_TOKEN=<Discord Bot Token> --from-literal PGHOST=postgres --from-literal PGPORT=5432 --from-literal PGDATABASE=cyberdisc-db --from-literal PGUSER=postgres --from-literal PGPASSWORD=<Postgres Password> --from-literal SENTRY_URL=<Sentry URL> --from-literal DEPLOY=<Anything>
```

These settings will then be distributed to the containers when you create them like this:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CyberDiscovery/cyberdisc-bot/master/deployment.yaml
```

### Bare Metal

You can also locally install the bot on your system. First install the dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
poetry install
```

Or on Windows:

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python
poetry install
```

If you don't already have the required Python version (currently 3.7.2) installed, install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) before running the above commands.

You will then need to set the bot token as an environment variable:

```bash
export BOT_TOKEN="<insert bot token here>"
```

Or on Windows:

```powershell
set BOT_TOKEN="<insert bot token here>"
```

Finally, run the command `poetry run cdbot` in the root of the repository to run the bot on your machine. To access admin commands of the bot, set the environment variable `ROOT_MEMBERS_ID` to the ID of your administrators group.
