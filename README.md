# Cyber Discovery Discord Bot [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/cyberdiscovery/Cyber%20Discovery%20Discord%20Bot/_apis/build/status/Cyber%20Discovery%20Discord%20Bot?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/cyberdiscovery/Cyber%20Discovery%20Discord%20Bot/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master) [![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/409851296116375565/embed.png)](https://discord.gg/AQPh34Y)
The bot for the Cyber Discovery Community Discord Server!

## Installation
To test the bot, you will need to setup a custom instance of it running locally. First install the dependencies with poetry:
```
pip install --user poetry
poetry install
```
If you don't already have the required Python version (currently 3.7.2) installed, install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) before running the above commands.

Whilst they are installing, head over to [the Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and create an application.
It needs a name, then go to the bots tab (on the left) and add a new bot. For testing purposes, it is best to have the bot private, so uncheck that option.
Copy the token (you need to click to reveal it) and set it as an environment variable:
```
export BOT_TOKEN="<insert bot token here>"
```
Or on Windows:
```
set BOT_TOKEN="<insert bot token here>"
```
Go back to the home page of your application on Discord and grab the client ID. Then put it into this url:
```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<insert client id here>&scope=bot&
```

Add it to a channel that you will use for testing.

Finally, run the command `poetry run cdbot` in the root of the repository to run the bot on your server. To access admin commands of the bot, add a group called `Root` to the server and add yourself to it.
